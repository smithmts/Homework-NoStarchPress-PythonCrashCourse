# Homework-NoStarchPress-PythonCrashCourse
This is my personal homework for No Starch Press Python Crash Course.

Matthes, Eric. (2019). Python Crash Course: A hands-on, project-based introduction to programming (2nd edition). No Starch Press.

All python files prefixed with chapter and activity numbers were created by me, with lots of reference to the material, of course. Other python files were entered verbatum examples from the book.  Similar/exact code can also be found in [the author's repository](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc_2e).
