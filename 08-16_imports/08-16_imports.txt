-Using a program you wrote that has one function in it, set up in a 
separate file.
-Import the function into the main program file, and call using each
of these approaches:
	-import module_name
	-from module_name import_function_name
	-from module_name import_function_name as fn
	-import module_name as mn
	-from module_name import *
